# Cheb's Mercenaries

Cheb's Mercenaries adds mercenaries to Valheim that you can purchase with gold and upgrade with materials to fight (warriors, archers) or perform work (lumberjacks, miners).

It is related to my other mod called [Cheb's Necromancy](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy) and shares a lot of concepts and functionality. It's basically for people that want living human minions rather than the undead.

## Features

Detailed info in the [wiki](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-mercenaries/wiki). Here's the short version:

- Almost everything is, or will soon be, configurable. Minions too weak/overpowered? Tweak them.
- Craftable structure at the workbench:
    + [**Mercenaries Chest**](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-mercenaries/wiki/MercenaryChest): Hire warriors, archers, miners, and lumberjacks.
- Put coins and other items in the chest to recruit a mercenary:
  - **Tier 1 warrior**: 5 CookedMeat, 1 Club
  - **Tier 2 warrior:** 25 Coins
  - **Tier 3 warrior:** 50 Coins
  - **Tier 4 warrior:** 100 Coins
  - **Tier 1 archer:** 5 CookedMeat, 20 ArrowWood
  - **Tier 2 archer:** 50 Coins, 10 ArrowBronze
  - **Tier 3 archer:** 100 Coins, 10 ArrowIron
  - **Miner:** 5 Coins, 1 HardAntler
  - **Woodcutter:** 5 Coins,  1 Flint
- Put extra stuff in there to give the mercenary clothing:
  - **Leather armor:** 2 DeerHide/LeatherScraps/Scales
  - **Troll armor:** 2 TrollHide
  - **Wolf armor:** 2 WolfPelt
  - **Lox armor:** 2 LoxPelt
  - **Bronze armor:** 1 Bronze
  - **Iron armor:** 1 Iron
  - **Black metal armor:** 1 Black Metal
- Ownership
  - Mercenaries have no owner until first activated (with E), after which they only ever respond to that one player.
- Roam/Wait/Follow
  - Works the same as in Cheb's Necromancy

### With Cheb's Necromancy Installed

If you have Cheb's Necromancy 3.0.0 or newer installed beside the mod, the wand should also work to command the mercenaries with:

- While holding a Skeleton Wand, Draugr Wand, or Orb of Beckoning you can control the minions:
    + **F** will make all nearby minions **follow** you.
    + **T** will make all nearby minions **wait**.
    + **Shift+T** will make minions **roam**.
    + **G** will teleport all following minions to your position (useful if stuck or to get them on boats)

### Config

**Attention:** To edit the config as described, the [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) is the most user friendly way. This is a separate mod. Please download and install it.

Press **F1** to open the mod's configuration panel.

You can also edit the configs manually. Almost everything can be tweaked to your liking. For a complete list of all configuration options, please look [here](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-mercenaries/wiki/Configs).

## Known issues

- Players with Radeon cards may experience weird issues. I don't know what's causing it, but it's linked to the particle effects. You can switch them off by turning `RadeonFriendly = true` in the config.

## Known Incompatibilities

- Soft incompatibility with [slope combat fix](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/180) because it can mess up worker minion aiming. Not a big deal - especially if you never use miners/woodcutters. As an alternative, you may consider (Slope Combat Assistance)[https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Digitalroot/Digitalroots_Slope_Combat_Assistance/] because it only affects the player.
- Soft incompatibility with [Ward is Love](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/177) because it will identify workers as enemies and yeet them. As an alternative, you may consider using [Better Wards](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/BetterWards/).
- Soft incompatibility with [Ward is Love](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-necromancy/issues/177) because it will identify workers as enemies and yeet them.

## Future Ideas

- None at the moment.
